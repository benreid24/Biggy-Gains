# Biggy Gains
Biggy Gains is a trading bot being developed by myself and my friend Chris just for fun. This repository contains the environment layer used by the
bots to interact with their world, as well as the bots themselves. Live trading and live paper trading will be done with [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/).

## Setup

virtualenv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt

Activate your virtualenv:

```
