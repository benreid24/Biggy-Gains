LTCM was our biggest counterparty, but then LTCM was *everybody\u2019s* biggest counterparty. Their abundance of PhDs and egos had created a colossus that generated tens of millions of dollars a month in profits for the banks trading with them.\n\nI was running interest rate derivatives for Chase Manhattan (later merged into JPMorgan). I received a phone call late one night from a colleague informing me that LTCM was collapsing due to many highly leveraged bets going awry simultaneously. The following morning, our head of credit summarized the exposures we and the other big counterparties had to LTCM. As with Archegos, an orderly liquidation of positions looked to be the best option. But the economic incentives were similar to a cartel \u2013 each member was incentivized to secretly cheat.\n\nThe LTCM bank group was apparently sworn to secrecy. The information I had been provided made me an insider \u2013 it was obvious what trades should be done to generate immediate profits (\u201cpay fixed in ten year swap spreads\u201d) but I respected the rules and waited. Goldman didn\u2019t.

Go look back at how information was released. This kept people interested and momentum going. \n\nnow $GME did the same things. Of course diluting the stock hurts us on value and the short squeeze. It sure did, dropped us to $160 a share or we roughly took a 20% hit. Then they said, but hey we are doing 11% better. So.. here came the price back with he believers picking up the discount. I even bought 2 more in the deep dip. Now, it is a matter of buy more, get more people involved as their business changes and success comes. However, it did not screw the end goal, delayed maybe.

Also, how do you get past the fear of \"parting\" with some of that fund? \n\nMy wife and I try to put away as much of our paycheck as we can. I am currently 35 and my wife is 31. Salary wise I pull in about 80k/annum while my wife brings in about 95k/annum. We currently do not have any children, but are expecting one soon.\n\nFor about the last decade we have both been contributing towards an employer 401k (initially It was very little/paycheck, but with each year we aggressively upped our contributions to the point where for the last 2 years we have been contributing 19.5k/year each (Wish we had started doing this earlier\u2026. But, better late than never I suppose). These contributions are split into a few different Vanguard funds. With regards to our individual investments here are the splits between the two of us:\n             \n\n401k (pre + post): $136k me, $90k wife\n\nROTH IRA (VT): $6k each\n\nVTI: $10k each\n\nIndividual companies: 50k me (spread across companies like TMO,  LMT, MSFT, V, MA, INTC, AMD, WM, AAPL, WMT, SQ, PYPL, AMZN, JPM @ approximately 2.5-3.5k/company\n\nTotal investments between the two of us = approximately 310k (260k vanguard funds + 50k individual picks)\n\n\nWe recently bought a house for which we were actively growing a cash pile for a down payment. We put down almost 65K for the house and have since been continuing to contribute to our employer provided 401k (We both contribute 19.5k each towards that (50% pretax + 50% post tax).\n\nWe both just started contributing towards a ROTH-IRA as well with plans of maxing that out at the start of each year (if possible) and invest that money into VT.\n\nThe issue (good issue I suppose) is that we currently have approximately 110k in cash in a high yielding savings account. We are still saving cash like we are trying to buy a house, and I think it has taken a little while for both of us to realize that we might just feel safer having a bunch of cash, but obviously this money in a savings account is not working as hard as investments in equities would. Realistically I can\u2019t see us needing more than 30-40k as a safety net for about a year (but since we are expecting our first child, we are not sure how that is really going to affect our finances and budgeting in too much detail. So far both of us plan to continue to be aggressive with savings and hopefully we can continue to max out our tax benefit accounts even if that means our cash savings will not appreciate as fast after having the baby. We both have been wondering if it would make sense to just dump about 50k of that savings into a few good ETFs (VTI + VXUS or just VT to keep things simple), but I was hoping people here could chime in and give us a few different perspectives.\n\nDo people here have any recommendations on how we could get over our fear of parting with our hard earned cash (even though the fear is irrational because these investments will not be touched for at least a decade)? The only debt we currently have is the mortgage payment.

The next ER for apha is pretty safe, though. No way they're going to rock the boat with inventory impairments or goodwill write downs, so there' isn't much chance of anything disastrous that could come out. Even if there is baggage, Tilray knows about it and accepts it because they know Aphria brings way more to the combination than Tilray does. \n\nAphria's biggest question mark is inventory. They bloated up to $320mC from just $70m in like one year. Those increase go directly into the bottom line through cgs. That stopped in the October ending quarter, though, which gave the stock a good fundamental catalyst to augment the U.S. opening meme. Nevertheless, as a company you have to either commit to FIFOing your way through the stockpile or writing off the aging inventory. Remember that Aphria's last audit was qualified--based on the auditor not being willing to sign off on goodwill and inventory. And that was after they down listed from NYSE to Nasdaq just a couple months before they had to post audited fins (imho to get an easier audit). \n\nI still think Aphria is FIFOing through and hopes to actually sell that $320m, but when you have more than a year in inventory, you'll be putting some old, dry, dusty stuff out there and risk alienating your customers. \n\nIt's also possible that I'm totally wrong and they'll come totally clean to avoid bringing baggage to the merger. I just don't think so. \n\nP.S.
